              <p>We've always approached spiritual technology this way. We look at our current prayer tools and ask ourselves why it's done the way it is. Why do prayer apps have social feeds? Why do we use categories and folders for our deepest conversations with God? Are these patterns serving our spiritual growth or just creating digital noise?</p>
              <p>With Dwelling Place we ultimately asked ourselves, why not? Why not find a different way to nurture our relationship with the divine? Why not remove all the distractions that get in the way of true connection? Forget how it's usually done. Why not make it sacred?</p>

            <p>There was a time when our spiritual tools were just tools. We picked up a prayer book to commune with God, then closed it when we were finished. It was a tool made for one sacred purpose. It had no ulterior motives.</p>
            <p>Fast forward to today, and our digital tools have evolved. They've become smarter, with algorithms, feeds, notifications. They are designed to make us spend as much time with them as possible. We must feed them, manage them, engage with them. Our tools no longer serve our spiritual purpose. We serve theirs.</p>

              Could we not use the gift of technology to build something better? Something that truly nurtures our souls, rather than distracting from them. Something designed to foster a sacred relationship with the divine once again. Something that serves a simple, holy purpose.

            <p>There's a reason we encourage fresh starts in your spiritual journey. We like the idea of beginning anew. Not only because faith revolves around rebirth and renewal, but this also requires you to reevaluate your relationship with the sacred. It inspires you to be more conscious, more intentional, more mindful of your prayers and reflections.</p>
            <p>Digital spiritual clutter affects our real minds and hearts, whether we're aware of it or not. We want your dwelling place to be a break from that. It's a clean sanctuary where you can deliberately choose what to save and reflect upon. A spiritual sigh of relief.</p>

              <p>We built Dwelling Place for seekers and believers. For people who are busy living their faith and simply need a sacred space to connect with God and remember what matters most.</p>
              <p>Dwelling Place doesn't interfere, doesn't overwhelm, and doesn't ask to be maintained. It's meant to serve you, as an extension of your spiritual life. So you can focus on prayer, reflection, and growthâ€”not the tool itself.</p>
              <p>Because that's all it is: A tool meant to help you achieve something greater. Those who like to organize and categorize their faith will find plenty of other apps to keep them busy. Dwelling Place is for those who would rather pray and reflect and serve and love and worship.</p>
